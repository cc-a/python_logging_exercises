# Python Logging Exercises

This repository contains some simple example code designed to demonstrate the
functionality of the Python `logging` module.

Look at the code in `mylib` then run through the script files in order. Try to look each
script and guess what output you'll see before running it.

The Python [reference] and [how-to] documentation for the `logging` module may help you
understand the behaviour you see.
